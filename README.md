# python-api-challenge

For me the material we covered this week was much easier to digest. The assignment itself wasn't too daunting and I was able to understand what it wanted me to do on an intuitive level; the fact that we were using APis that we had already covered in class made it very easy to port our practice into the weekly challenge. Outside of referencing Pandas and API documentation, all code was written from myself or from week 6 student activities.
